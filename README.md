# Firefly

# About the Project
Firefly is a rendering engine I create for my Informatics courses. It's prone to be enhanced in a short lapse of time.
At this day, he can upload and render simple mesh with a Cook-Torrence shader.

# Building Firefly
Cmake is the building tools used for this project, with a minimum version of 2.8.
If you don"t have Cmake, you can download it at http://www.cmake.org/.

First Step : To maximize space, the library are compressed. Think to unzip them before building !

Unix:
   1. >>mkdir build
   2. >>cd build
   3. >>cmake ..
   4. >>make

Windows:
  Don't know yet how it can work... I think Mingw or Cmake can do the job
  
# Acknowledment:
Firefly is based on the Assimp and the GLM Library. You can get them at :

    GLM : http://glm.g-truc.net/
